## Presentation of the Labor Force Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Presentation of the labor force data
```

We are studying the labor force in the United States from 1941 to 2010 (raw data originally from BLS.gov -- https://www.bls.gov/cps/aa2010/aat1.txt). The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file. Each row holds labor force information for a single year, and the column represent:

| Column             | Description                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| year               | year of observation                                         |
| civ\_noninst\_pop  | civilian noninstitutional population                        |
| civ\_lf\_tot       | total civilian labor force                                  |
| pct\_pop           | percent of population                                       |
| emp\_tot           | total employed                                              |
| emp\_pct\_pop      | percent of employed population                              |
| emp\_ag\_tot       | population employed in agriculture                          |
| emp\_nonag\_tot    | population employed in non-agriculture                      |
| unemp              | unemployment                                                |
| unemp\_pct\_lf     | percent of unemployed in labor force                        |
| not\_in\_lf        | not in labor force                                          |
| footnotes          | notes on data                                               |
| president          | president (majority of the year)                            |
| party              | political party of the president                            |

To download the data into the `data/` subdirectory, run the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/economics-datacarpentry/R-economics-lesson/gh-pages/data/aat1.csv",
              "data/aat1.csv")
```


We are going to use the R function `read_csv()` from the `readr` package to read the CSV file that contains the labor force data to load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`.

Load the data from the `\data` subdirectory:

```{r, eval=TRUE,  purl=FALSE}
library(readr)
unemp <- read_csv('data/aat1.csv')
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because, as you might recall, assignments don't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been loaded, we can print the variable's value: `unemp`.

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded properly. Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the function `head()`:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
head(unemp)
```

`readr` gives us feedback about how it parsed the csv. For example, it recognized that the `year` column only contained integer values and decided to store that column as an integer vector. This saves space in memory and removes the need for us to do this manually. 

The variable names in the csv, though very descriptive, are not friendly to type. So we might like to rename the variables then save the data and a codebook to disk for later use.

```{r}
# new names for the columns
short_names <- c('year',
                 'civ_noninst_pop',
                 'civ_lf_tot',
                 'pct_pop',
                 'emp_tot',
                 'emp_pct_pop',
                 'emp_ag_tot',
                 'emp_nonag_tot',
                 'unemp',
                 'unemp_pct_lf',
                 'not_in_lf',
                 'footnotes',
                 'president',
                 'party')
               
# create a codebook with the new names, old names, and the type of each column
codebook <- data.frame(name = short_names,
                       descripition = names(unemp),
                       type = as.character(lapply(unemp,typeof)))
                     
# now rename the variables
names(unemp) <- short_names
```

Now that it is saved, let's keep working with the data and see what we else can do. The `dplyr` package is an excellent way to manipulate data frame and summarize data.

##### Exploring with dplyr and ggplot2

```{r}
library(dplyr)
unemp %>% summarise(first=min(year),last=max(year))
```

The dplyr `%>%` notation means, take the output of the thing on the left and pass it to the thing on the right. It is a fancy way of doing function composition. Instead of writing `f(g(h(x)))` we can write `x %>% h() %>% g() %>% f()`. Writing it this way makes it easier to remove `g()` if we don't want it to be part of the pipeline of operations anymore.

We can also plot the unemployment rate easily with the `ggplot2` package. I give you the following code without much explanation, but it will be covered in a later lesson.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
library(ggplot2)
unemp %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,unemp_pct_lf)) + 
  geom_line() + labs(y="Unemployment Rate",x="")
```

By slightly altering the code above, we can also plot the share of those employed in agriculture. We would expect to see it drop over time.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
unemp %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,emp_ag_tot/emp_tot)) + 
  geom_line() + labs(y="Share Employed in Agriculture",x="")
```

## What are data frames?

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for most tabular data, and what we
use for statistics and plotting.

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because the column are
vectors, they all contain the same type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE, results='show'}
str(unemp)
```

## Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

* Size:
    * `dim(unemp)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
          and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
          the object)
    * `nrow(unemp)` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol(unemp)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
    * `head(unemp)` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail(unemp)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
    * `names(unemp)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	   objects)
    * `rownames(unemp)` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str(unemp)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
	   content of  each column
    * `summary(unemp)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.

## Indexing and subsetting data frames

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Indexing and subsetting data frames
```


Our unemp data frame has rows and columns (2 dimensions). If we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note
that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with
different classes.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
unemp[1]      # first column in the data frame (as a data.frame)
unemp[, 1]    # first column in the data frame (as a vector)
unemp[1, 1]   # first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
unemp[1, 6]   # first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
unemp[1:3, 7] # first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
unemp[3, ]    # the 3rd element for all columns (as a data.frame)
head_unemp <- unemp[1:6, ] # equivalent to head(unemp)
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain parts of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
unemp[,-1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
unemp[-c(7:34786),] # Equivalent to head(unemp)
```

As well as using numeric values to subset a `data.frame` (or `matrix`), columns
can be called by name, using one of the four following notations:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
unemp["pct_pop"]       # Result is a data.frame
unemp[, "pct_pop"]     # Result is a vector
unemp[["pct_pop"]]     # Result is a vector
unemp$pct_pop          # Result is a vector
```

For our purposes, the last three notations are equivalent. RStudio knows about
the columns in your data frame, so you can take advantage of the autocompletion
feature to get the full and correct column name.

## Factors

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Factors
```

When we did `str(unemp)` we saw that several of the columns consist of
integers, however, the columns `genus`, `species`, `sex`, `plot_type`, ... are
of a special class called a `factor`. Factors are very useful and are actually
something that make R particularly well suited to working with data, so we're
going to spend a little time introducing them.

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or
unordered, and understanding them is necessary for statistical analysis and for
plotting.

Factors are stored as integers, and have labels (text) associated with these
unique integers. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors,
they are actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when
treating them like strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts *levels* in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because
`f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this vector is
`"male"`). You can check this by using the function `levels()`, and check the
number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high"),
it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of
analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in the `sex` vector would be:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
sex # current order
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex # after re-ordering
```

In R's memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), but are more
informative than integers because factors are self describing: `"female"`,
`"male"` is more descriptive than `1`, `2`. Which one is "male"?  You wouldn't
be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, on the other hand, have
this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels
(like the species names in our example dataset).

### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
as.character(sex)
```

Converting factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration
levels, or years) to a numeric vector is a little trickier.  One method is to
convert factors to characters and then numbers.  Another method is to use the
`levels()` function. Compare:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
f <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(f)               # wrong! and there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(f)) # works...
as.numeric(levels(f))[f]    # The recommended way.
```

Notice that in the `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:

* We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(f)`
* We convert these levels to numeric values using `as.numeric(levels(f))`
* We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the
  vector `f` inside the square brackets

### Renaming factors

When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the `plot()` function to get a
quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor
level. Let's look at the number of males and females captured over the course of
the experiment:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
## bar plot of the number of females and males captured during the experiment:
## TODO
#plot(surveys$sex)
```

In addition to males and females, there are about 1700 individuals for which the
sex information hasn't been recorded. Additionally, for the these individuals,
there is no label to indicate that the information is missing. Let's rename this
label to something more meaningful. Before doing that, we're going to pull out
the data on sex and work with that data, so we're not modifying the working copy
of the data frame:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
sex <- surveys$sex
head(sex)
levels(sex)
levels(sex)[1] <- "missing"
levels(sex)
head(sex)
```


> ### Challenge
>
> * Rename "F" and "M" to "female" and "male" respectively.
> * Now that we have renamed the factor level to "missing", can you recreate the
>  barplot such that "missing" is last (after "male")?


```{r wrong-order, results='show', echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
## Challenges
##
## * Rename "F" and "M" to "female" and "male" respectively.
## * Now that we have renamed the factor level to "missing", can you recreate the
##   barplot such that "missing" is last (after "male")
```


<!---
```{r correct-order, purl=FALSE}
## Answers
levels(sex)[2:3] <- c("female", "male")
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male", "missing"))
plot(sex)
```
--->

### Using `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`

By default, when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain
characters (i.e., text) are coerced (=converted) into the `factor` data
type. Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these
columns as `character`. To do so, `read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an
argument called `stringsAsFactors` which can be set to `FALSE`.

In most cases, it's preferable to set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when importing
your data, and converting as a factor only the columns that require this data
type.

Compare the output of `str(surveys)` when setting `stringsAsFactors = TRUE`
(default) and `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`:


```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Compare the difference between when the data are being read as
## `factor`, and when they are being read as `character`.
surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(surveys)
surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(surveys)
## Convert the column "plot_type" into a factor
surveys$plot_type <- factor(surveys$plot_type)
```

The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes an
annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check that data
you import in R are of the correct type within your data frame. If not, use it
to your advantage to detect mistakes that might have been introduced during data
entry (a letter in a column that should only contain numbers for instance.).
